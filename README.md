## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vite-project

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Email/Password authentication.
   - Enable Firestore Database.
   - Copy the Firebase configuration and set up environment variables as described below.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Firestore Security Rules

Ensure that your Firestore security rules allow authenticated users to read and write to the `posts` collection. Here is an example:

```plaintext
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /posts/{post} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

To set up these rules:

1. Go to the Firebase Console.
2. Select your project.
3. Navigate to Firestore Database in the left-hand menu.
4. Click on the "Rules" tab at the top of the Firestore page.
5. Update the rules with the provided example and publish the changes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run serve`

Serves the production build from the `dist` folder.
